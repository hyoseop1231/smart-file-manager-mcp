Algorithms form the backbone of coding, providing a set of instructions for solving problems efficiently. They are essential for operations such as searching, sorting, and data manipulation. Efficient algorithms reduce computational time and memory usage, making applications faster and more resource-efficient. Popular algorithms include binary search, quicksort, and Dijkstra's shortest path, each serving unique purposes. Mastery in algorithms enables developers to optimize performance and build scalable software solutions. Understanding algorithm complexity, including Big O notation, is crucial for analyzing efficiency and making informed decisions in software development.Algorithms form the backbone of coding, providing a set of instructions for solving problems efficiently.
