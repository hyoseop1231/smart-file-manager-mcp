## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/smart-file-manager-mcp.git
   cd smart-file-manager-mcp
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment:**
   ```bash
   cd ai-services
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Node.js environment:**
   ```bash
   cd ../mcp-server
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run tests to ensure everything is working:**
   ```bash
   # Python tests
   cd ../ai-services
   pytest

   # TypeScript tests
   cd ../mcp-server
   npm test
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start services in development mode:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

2. **Make your changes**

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   # Python
   docker-compose exec smart-file-manager pytest

   # TypeScript
   cd mcp-server && npm test
   ```

4. **Check code style:**
   ```bash
   # Python
   black . --check --line-length 120
   ruff check .

   # TypeScript
   npm run lint
   ```

## Style Guides

### Python Style Guide

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting and [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/) for linting.

- Line length: 120 characters
- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions

**Example:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def search_files(
    query: str,
    directories: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    limit: int = 50
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Search for files using natural language query.
    
    Args:
        query: Natural language search query
        directories: Optional list of directories to search in
        limit: Maximum number of results to return
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing search results and metadata
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### TypeScript Style Guide

We use ESLint with Prettier for TypeScript code.

- Use meaningful variable names
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use async/await over promises where possible
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Handles file search requests from Claude Desktop
 * @param params - Search parameters from MCP protocol
 * @returns Search results formatted for MCP
 */
export async function handleSearchFiles(
  params: SearchParams
): Promise<SearchResult> {
  const { query, limit = 50 } = params;
  
  try {
    const results = await searchAPI.search(query, limit);
    return formatResults(results);
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Search failed:', error);
    throw new MCPError('Search operation failed');
  }
}
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep README.md updated with any new features
- Document all configuration options

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples
```
feat(search): add semantic search using embeddings

Implemented vector embeddings for semantic file search using
the nomic-embed-text model. This allows finding conceptually
similar files even when exact keywords don't match.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(api): resolve 422 error in MCP protocol handling

Added raw request handling to bypass Pydantic validation
issues when receiving requests from Claude Desktop.
```
